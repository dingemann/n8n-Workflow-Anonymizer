## ü§î Why This Tool?

Sharing n8n workflows is a great way to collaborate and get help, but they often contain sensitive information like API keys, credential IDs, and personal identifiers. Manually cleaning these files is tedious, error-prone, and risky.

This tool automates the process, providing a fast, reliable, and secure way to anonymize your workflows with confidence.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **100% Browser-Based:** All processing happens locally on your machine. Your files and data never leave your browser.
*   **Zero Dependencies:** It's a single HTML file. No installation, no build tools, no `npm install`. Just download and open.
*   **Automatic Detection:** Intelligently finds sensitive data based on common n8n patterns and keywords.
*   **Interactive Control:** Review all potential changes in a clear mapping table and choose what to anonymize with simple checkboxes.
*   **Comprehensive Reports:** Download the cleaned JSON workflow and a Markdown report detailing every change made.
*   **Modern UI:** Clean, minimalist interface with both Light and Dark modes.
*   **Drag & Drop:** A quick and easy way to load your workflow file.

3.  **Upload:** Drag and drop your n8n workflow `.json` file onto the designated area, or click to select it from your computer.
4.  **Review & Customize:** The app will instantly analyze the file.

## üîé What It Anonymizes

The tool is designed to detect and replace the following types of sensitive information:

| Data Type | Example Field Paths & Patterns | Placeholder |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Credential IDs & Names** | `credentials.openAiApi.id`<br>`credentials.googleSheetsOAuth2Api.name` | `YOUR_OPENAI_CREDENTIAL_ID`<br>`Your Google Sheets Credential` |
| **API Keys & Tokens** | `parameters.apiKey.value`<br>`headerParameters[].value` where `name` is `x-api-key` or `Authorization`<br>`queryParameters[].value` where `name` is `key` or `cx` | `YOUR_API_KEY`<br>`Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN` |
| **Google Document IDs** | `parameters.documentId.value`<br>ID extracted from `parameters.documentId.cachedResultUrl` | An empty string (`""`) |
| **Instance & Metadata** | `meta.instanceId`<br>Root-level `id`<br>`settings.errorWorkflow` | `YOUR_N8N_INSTANCE_ID`<br>`YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID`<br>An empty string (`""`) |
| **Email Addresses** | Any string matching an email pattern found in values. | `your-email@example.com` |

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

This is the most important feature of the tool.

*   **Everything is Local:** The application logic runs entirely within your web browser using JavaScript.
*   **No Server Communication:** Your files, their contents, and any derived data are **never** sent to a server. You can verify this by checking the network tab in your browser's developer tools.
*   **Offline Use:** Once you've downloaded the `anonymizer.html` file, you can disconnect from the internet and the tool will still work perfectly.
*   **Open Source:** The complete source code is in a single, easy-to-read file. You can inspect it yourself to be 100% sure of what it does.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (with CSS Variables for easy theming)
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
